 Title: "Nordstrom Website"

 Welcome to the Nordstrom Clone, a project where I replicated the design and functionality of the Nordstrom website. This project serves as a learning exercise and showcases my ability to recreate a complex and feature-rich website.

Introduction: - The Nordstrom Clone project is a result of my exploration into web development, aiming to understand the intricacies of front-end design, user experience, and the underlying technologies that power modern e-commerce platforms. By cloning Nordstrom, a popular online retail destination, I gained valuable insights into responsive design, layout structuring, and the integration of various components.

Features: -
  ->Responsive Design: The Nordstrom Clone is built with a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless and consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Most important Things: "Design"

  App.css:- How to design great for look, I took 70+ hours to find best way for presenation. How could I give best presentation, Then I revise some topics from the templates and cheatsheets learnt from Twitter. Then decided to recreate css, I tried 1000+ lines of codes             perhaps 2 times for better results. Then I got this.

  Issues: Some issues Which I faced: While creating React app, installation, errors, many errors I faced which are highly note solve easily, My minds got sucked when I show many erros facing, I contact with my IA for solve this, after understanding some topics and                learn some new things from youtube then understande what I making mistakes then I stoped it. And create Again with taking some guidelines from the best platforms.

  I deleted many times all codes, full folders, more things when I faced problems that tiems, I transfrred my project many times with Javascript+ SWC then transferred to Typescript +SWC. Many times!

  This is my first website Experience:
